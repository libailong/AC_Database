Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository contains the starter files for Lab 4 in Computer Science 312.

## Introduction
In this lab, you are to write code to take user inputs and apply them to a database to insert and make changes. Your program will be working with several attributes from the tables. You will have to keep track (somehow) of which attributes belong to what table so that your program is able to ask the user about each for an insert.


## Sample Output
For both the INSERT and the Editing of data, your program should function similar to that one shown below.

Sample program usage:

---

```
python3 myQueryProgram.py

Welcome to my database automation program!
Enter table name: Instructor
 + Note: There are < 5 > attributes associated with table < instructor >.

Enter ID value       : 11111
Enter name value     : Stephenson
Enter student value  : S13
Enter deptName value : CompBio
Enter salary value   : 120000

 + Instructor table BEFORE insert:
       ...

 + Instructor table AFTER insert:
11111|Stephenson|S13|CompBio|120000

End of program
```


A carefully formatted assignment sheet for this project provides more details about the steps that you should take to complete this assignment.
